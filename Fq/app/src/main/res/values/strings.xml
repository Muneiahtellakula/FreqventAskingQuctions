    <string-array name="soil_sutable">
    <item>All over the country, different types of soil could be found and each type has unique <phys></phys>ical, chemical and biological characteristics. Alluvial soil is considered as the most fertile soil containing potassium in it and is suitable for agricultural crops like sugarcane, paddy and plantain. Red soil has high iron content and is used for gram, groundnut and castor seed cultivation. Black soil has high calcium, magnesium and potassium used of chilly, jowar, cotton, oilseed and maize cultivation. Finally, sandy soil has low nutrient content, but is useful in growing crops like coconut.

    <item>The different branches of agriculture are horticulture, aquaculture, dairy farming, organic farming, poultry, sericulture, vermiculture and market gardening.

    <string-array name="rabhi_">
    <item>The name “Rabi” means “spring” – a word derived from Arabic.\n
The crops that are grown in the winter season and harvested in the spring are called Rabi crops.\n
Wheat, gram, and mustard are some of the Rabi crops.\n
Various agricultural practices are carried out to produce new crop varieties.\n
Such crops require a warm climate for the germination and maturation of seeds. \nThey, however, require a cold climate for their growth.

    <string-array name="zaid_">
    <item>Such crops are grown between the Kharif and Rabi seasons, i.e., between March and June./n
These crops mature early./n
Cucumber, pumpkin, bitter gourd, and watermelon are zaid crops.

    <string-array name="kharif">
        <item>The crops which are grown in the monsoon season are known as Kharif crops. For eg., maize, millet, and cotton.\n
The seeds are sown at the beginning of monsoon season and harvested at the end of the monsoon season.\n
Such crops require a lot of water and hot weather for proper growth.

    <string-array name="crop_insurence">
        <item> Because agriculture is inherently unpredictable, it is important to take preventative measures to mitigate some of the damage farmers face when crops fail. That’s where crop insurance comes in. Crop insurance helps to stabilize farmers’ incomes by protecting them against losses, minimizing debts and protecting crop yields.</item>

    <string-array name="land_clean">
        <item>
        The process of removing trees, stumps, brush, stones and other unwanted substances from the farm area is called land clearing. Doing so improves the productivity of the land and provides a new land base for next crop cycle. The land clearing process also involves piling up the debris and disposing it by burning the pile. Land is cleared using clearing equipment maintained by trained operators. Pilingrakes and blades are also used while cleaning
